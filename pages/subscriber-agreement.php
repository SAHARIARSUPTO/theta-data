            <h2 class="mt-5">WHEREAS</h2>
            <p>Licensor has compiled data into the proprietary data compilation described in Exhibit A, and such proprietary data compilation is referred to in this Agreement as (the "Data"); and</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">NOW, THEREFORE</h2>
            <p>In consideration of the mutual covenants, terms, and conditions set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">1. License</h3>
            <p><strong>(a) License Grant.</strong> Subject to and conditioned on Licensee's payment of Fees and compliance with all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 9(g)) license during the Term to use the Data solely for Licensee's internal personal use purposes/the permitted use set forth in Exhibit A (the "Permitted Use"). The total number of users/amounts of usage by the Licensee will not exceed the limits set forth in Exhibit A, except as expressly agreed to in writing by the Parties and subject to any appropriate adjustment of the fees payable hereunder.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Use Restrictions.</strong> Licensee shall only use the Data for the Permitted Use and shall not disclose, release, distribute, or deliver the Data, or any portion thereof, to any third party without Licensor's prior written consent. Any purpose or use not specifically authorized herein is prohibited unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensor. Without limiting the foregoing and except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Licensee shall not at any time, directly or indirectly: (i) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Data, in whole or in part; (ii) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Data; (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to the source of the Data or methods used to compile the Data, in whole or in part; (iv) remove any proprietary notices included within the Data; (v) publish, enhance, or display any compilation or directory based upon information derived from the Data; or (vi) use the Data in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person, or that violates any applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>(c) Reservation of Rights.</strong> Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Licensee or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to the Data.</p>
            <p><strong>(d) Delivery.</strong> Licensor shall deliver the Data electronically, on tangible media, or by other means, in Licensor's sole discretion, on an intra-day basis to Licensee. Risk of loss of any tangible media on which the Data is delivered will pass to Licensee on delivery to carrier.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">2. Fees and Payment</h3>
            <p><strong>(a) Fees.</strong> Licensee shall pay Licensor the fees ("Fees") set forth in Exhibit A without offset or deduction. Licensee shall make all payments hereunder in US dollars on or before the due date set forth in Exhibit A. If Licensee fails to make any payment when due, in addition to all other remedies that may be available: (i) Licensor may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1% per day calculated daily and compounded daily or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law; and (ii) Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs incurred by Licensor in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and (iii) if such failure continues for 30 days following written notice thereof, Licensor may prohibit access to the Data until all past due amounts and interest thereon have been paid, without incurring any obligation or liability to Licensee or any other person by reason of such prohibition of access to the Data; and (iv) At Licensorâ€™s discretion, Licensor has the unilateral right to terminate service/prohibit access to the Data immediately after a payment is overdue, superseding the aforementioned items.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Taxes.</strong> All Fees and other amounts payable by Licensee under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Licensee is responsible for all sales, use and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Licensee hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Licensor's income.</p>
            <p><strong>(c) Auditing Rights and Required Records.</strong> Licensee agrees to maintain complete and accurate records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles during the Term and for a period of two years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to matters necessary for accurately determining amounts due hereunder. Licensor may, at its own expense, on reasonable prior notice, periodically inspect and audit Licensee's records with respect to matters covered by this Agreement, provided that if such inspection and audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid Licensor with respect to any amounts due and payable during the Term, Licensee shall promptly pay the amounts necessary to rectify such underpayment, together with interest in accordance with Section 2(a). Licensee shall pay for the costs of the audit if the audit determines that Licensee's underpayment equals or exceeds 5% for any quarter. Such inspection and auditing rights will extend throughout the Term of this Agreement and continue for a period of two years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">3. Confidential Information and Data Security</h3>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (x) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the Party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (y) to establish a Party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. On the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, containing the disclosing Party's Confidential Information and, on request, certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been returned or destroyed.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Data Security.</strong> Licensee shall use all reasonable legal, organizational, physical, administrative, and technical measures, and security procedures to safeguard and ensure the security of the Data and to protect the Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, use, modification, or loss.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">4. Intellectual Property Ownership</h3>
            <p>Licensee acknowledges that, as between Licensee and Licensor, Licensor and/or Licensorâ€™s affiliates owns all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Data.

            <p><strong>(i) Equitable Relief.</strong> Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 3 or, in the case of Licensee, Section 1(b) would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.</p>
